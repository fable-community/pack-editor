      "description": "The only thing I can remember is coming to in the middle of an unfamiliar snowscape. Where that was or how I got there, I don't know. I couldn't even remember my own name. The memories just wouldn't come.\n\nI only had a moment, left at a loss, to ponder what to do — but fate seemed intent on furthering my misery as a giant, insect-like monster burst from the snow and ice to attack me.\n\nNaturally, I ran like hell. The creature cornered me anyway.\n\nThat's when SHE appeared, as if from nowhere — the beautiful, mysterious girl who saved my life.\n\nShe told me her name was Kuon. A beautiful, mysterious girl...\n\n...with a tail and ears like a beast's\n\n(Source: Atlus)",
